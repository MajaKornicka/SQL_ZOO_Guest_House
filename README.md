### Medium Problems

 <br>

6. Ruth Cadbury. Show the total amount payable by guest Ruth Cadbury for her room bookings. You should JOIN to the rate table using room_type_requested and occupants.

```sql
SELECT SUM(nights*amount) as total_amount
FROM booking
JOIN rate ON booking.room_type_Requested = rate.room_type 
AND booking.occupants = rate.occupancy
WHERE guest_id = (
                  SELECT id
                  FROM guest
                  WHERE first_name = 'Ruth' 
                  AND last_name = 'Cadbury')
```
Result

|total_amount|
|----|
|552.00|

 <br>
  <br>



7. Including Extras. Calculate the total bill for booking 5346 including extras.

 ``` sql
SELECT  (amount*nights) + (SELECT SUM(amount)
                           FROM extra
                           WHERE booking_id = 5346 ) as total_amount
FROM booking
JOIN rate ON booking.room_type_Requested = rate.room_type 
AND booking.occupants = rate.occupancy
WHERE booking.booking_id = 5346
```

Result
|total_amount|
|----|
|118.56|

 <br>
  <br>

8. Edinburgh Residents. For every guest who has the word ‚ÄúEdinburgh‚Äù in their address show the total number of nights booked. Be sure to include 0 for those guests who have never had a booking. Show last name, first name, address and number of nights. Order by last name then first name.

```sql
SELECT last_name, 
       first_name, 
       address, 
       CASE 
           WHEN SUM(nights) IS NULL THEN 0
           ELSE SUM(nights) 
       END as nights
FROM guest
LEFT JOIN booking ON guest.id = booking.guest_id
WHERE address LIKE '%Edinburgh%'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 1,2
```


Result
|last_name|first_name|address|nights|
|--------|------------|-------|-------|
|Brock	|Deidre	|Edinburgh North and Leith	|0|
|Cherry|	Joanna	|Edinburgh South West	|0|
|Murray|	Ian|	Edinburgh South	|13|
|Sheppard|	Tommy|	Edinburgh East	|0|
|Thomson|	Michelle|	Edinburgh West	|3|

9. How busy are we? For each day of the week beginning 2016-11-25 show the number of bookings starting that day. Be sure to show all the days of the week in the correct order.

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(booking_date, "%Y-%m-%d") as booking_date, COUNT(arrival_time) as arrivals
FROM booking
WHERE booking_date BETWEEN '2016-11-25' AND DATE_ADD('2016-11-25', INTERVAL 6 DAY)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```


Results

|booking_date|arrivals|
|------------|--------|
|2016-11-25	|7|
|2016-11-26	|8|
|2016-11-27|	12|
|2016-11-28	|7|
|2016-11-29	|13|
|2016-11-30	|6|
|2016-12-01	|7|

10. How many guests? Show the number of guests in the hotel on the night of 2016-11-21. Include all occupants who checked in that day but not those who checked out.

```sql
WITH checked_in_guests AS (
SELECT occupants, nights,
       DATE_FORMAT(booking_date, "%Y-%m-%d") as check_in, 
       DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(booking_date, INTERVAL (nights) DAY), "%Y-%m-%d") as check_out
FROM booking)

SELECT SUM(occupants) as total_guests
FROM checked_in_guests
WHERE check_in <= "2016-11-21"
AND check_out > "2016-11-21"
```


Results

|total_guests|
|------------|
|39|

### Hard Problems

 <br>
11. Coincidence. Have two guests with the same surname ever stayed in the hotel on the evening? Show the last name and both first names. Do not include duplicates.


```sql
WITH dates AS (
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(booking_date, "%Y-%m-%d") as check_in, 
       DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(booking_date, INTERVAL (nights) DAY), "%Y-%m-%d") as check_out,
       guest_id,
       last_name,
       first_name
FROM booking
JOIN guest ON guest.id = booking.guest_id),

names AS (
SELECT d1.last_name as d1_last, d1.first_name AS d1_first, d2.last_name AS d2_last, d2.first_name as d2_first
FROM dates d1
JOIN dates d2 ON d2.check_in >= d1.check_in AND d2.check_in < d1.check_out
WHERE d1.last_name = d2.last_name
AND d1.guest_id <> d2.guest_id
)

SELECT distinct d1_last as last_name, d1_first as first_name, d2_first as first_name_2
FROM names
WHERE d1_first > d2_first
ORDER BY 1
````

Results


|last_name	|first_name	|first_name_2|
|--------|---------|----------|
|Davies|	Philip	|David T. C.|
|Evans|	Mr Nigel	|Graham|
|Howarth	|Sir Gerald	|Mr George|
|Jones|	Susan Elan	|Mr Marcus|
|Lewis	|Dr Julian	|Clive|
|McDonnell|	John	|Dr Alasdair|

  12. Check out per floor. The first digit of the room number indicates the floor ‚Äì e.g. room 201 is on the 2nd floor. For each day of the week beginning 2016-11-14 show how many rooms are being vacated that day by floor number. Show all days in the correct order.

```sql
WITH basic AS (
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(booking_date, INTERVAL (nights) DAY), "%Y-%m-%d") as check_out, 
       room_no
FROM booking)

SELECT check_out,
       SUM(CASE WHEN room_no LIKE '1%' THEN 1
           ELSE 0
           END) AS 1st,

       SUM(CASE WHEN room_no LIKE '2%' THEN 1
           ELSE 0
           END) AS 2nd,

       SUM(CASE WHEN room_no LIKE '3%' THEN 1
           ELSE 0
           END) AS 3rd
FROM basic
WHERE check_out >= "2016-11-14" AND check_out <= DATE_ADD("2016-11-14" , INTERVAL 6 DAY)
GROUP BY check_out
ORDER BY check_out

```

Results

|check_out|	1st	|2nd	|3rd|
|--------|-----|--------|----------|
|2016-11-14	|5|	3	|4|
|2016-11-15	|6	|4	|1|
|2016-11-16	|2	|2	|4|
|2016-11-17	|5	|3	|6|
|2016-11-18	|2	|3	|2|
|2016-11-19	|5	|5	|1|

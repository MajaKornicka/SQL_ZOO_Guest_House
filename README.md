6. Ruth Cadbury. Show the total amount payable by guest Ruth Cadbury for her room bookings. You should JOIN to the rate table using room_type_requested and occupants.

```sql
SELECT SUM(nights*amount) as total_amount
FROM booking
JOIN rate ON booking.room_type_Requested = rate.room_type 
AND booking.occupants = rate.occupancy
WHERE guest_id = (
                  SELECT id
                  FROM guest
                  WHERE first_name = 'Ruth' 
                  AND last_name = 'Cadbury')
```
Result

|total_amount|
|----|
|552.00|

7. Including Extras. Calculate the total bill for booking 5346 including extras.

 ``` sql
SELECT  (amount*nights) + (SELECT SUM(amount)
                           FROM extra
                           WHERE booking_id = 5346 ) as total_amount
FROM booking
JOIN rate ON booking.room_type_Requested = rate.room_type

8. Edinburgh Residents. For every guest who has the word ‚ÄúEdinburgh‚Äù in their address show the total number of nights booked. Be sure to include 0 for those guests who have never had a booking. Show last name, first name, address and number of nights. Order by last name then first name.

```sql
SELECT last_name, 
       first_name, 
       address, 
       CASE 
           WHEN SUM(nights) IS NULL THEN 0
           ELSE SUM(nights) 
       END as nights
FROM guest
LEFT JOIN booking ON guest.id = booking.guest_id
WHERE address LIKE '%Edinburgh%'
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 1,2
```


Result
|last_name|first_name|address|nights|
|--------|------------|-------|-------|
|Brock	|Deidre	|Edinburgh North and Leith	|0|
|Cherry|	Joanna	|Edinburgh South West	|0|

FROM booking
WHERE booking_date BETWEEN '2016-11-25' AND DATE_ADD('2016-11-25', INTERVAL 6 DAY)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
